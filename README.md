The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Please, use ###yarn### to start up the application.

Autotests werent required, but i prefer to do them. If you'll need **autotests** please, let me know, i will do.

instead of **BEM** i used `sass-modules` so it allows me to use maximum short naming
